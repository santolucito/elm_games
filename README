Connecting Elm to Phonegap to create FRP apps!

Don't use any raw css, stick to doing everything in Elm. 
Probably some way to use both Elm HTML and Phonegap HTML, but will figure that out later.

onyl use relative paths for images "imgs/hero.png", not "/imgs/hero.png"

'elm-make MyProgram.elm' gives you the .js file to put into the phonegap project

then just add 'Elm.fullscreen(Elm.MyProgram);' in a sensible place in the index.js file of phonegap
right now I just put it in 
   
    initialize: function() {...

probably a better place to put it, but works for now

Finally, zip that shit up and send it to Phonegap Build. all done!
